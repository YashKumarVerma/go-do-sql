# go-do-sql

![Build package](https://github.com/YashKumarVerma/go-do-sql/workflows/Build%20package/badge.svg)

This project is an attempt to vent out the grudges against common education practices that focus on everything but skill development. 


## What this does / features
This is a command line application (CLI) which makes it easy to generate sql tables and fill dummy data without pain.

**Features**
- Rich CLI with autocomplete (yeah, autocomplete in cli) to describe table structures.
- Help boxes to display small message with auto-complete to assist new users
- Generates MySQL, (Oracle coming soon) table structure for given schema, and write output to file for easy i/o
- Generate a template to fill data manually by omitting fields which don't need to be disturbed (like auto-complete).
- Use built-in data generator to **fill** data into the columns.
- Support for adding length properties by default.

## Supported Fill options
- name
- email
- address
- city
- country
- zip
- car
- color
- url
- animal
- int

## Working
After running the application, enter the name of the table as requested. Table name is required because many commands require an explicit table name, the most important one being `create table`

The data can be selected from any of the above mentioned categories.

When you have entered the data and can't wait any longer, enter **exit**

Once you exit the shell, the cli generates the data for you. You can inspect the commands in the terminal itself,

Often it might be problematic to copy from terminals due to various reason, therefore all the generated data can be found in the **`/output`** directory. All the files start with the table name as prefix, so do not worry about collisions.

The **`*.insert.template.txt`** contains a single line with columns you need to insert while filling data manually.

If you want to access the random data generated by the cli, view the **`*.insert.filled.txt`** file. By default 10 entries are created.

You might need the commands to create table, afterall, that's the reason we specified details of the columns. The table creation command is located in **`*.table.txt`** file.
